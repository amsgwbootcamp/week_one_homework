# week_one_homework:

Modified the following files:
-- index.html
-- style.css

Added the following HTML5 tags to the file:
--body
--header
--nav
--main
--aside
--footer

Also, added to the alt attribute to all of the image tags so if the picture can't be displayed, the screen reader
will be able to describe the picture to the user.  

Added underlining for the links that can be clicked to help aid the user.  

The style.css was revised as well to take advantage of the new HTML5 tags that were mentioned above.  
Styles were also combined where it was appropriate.
